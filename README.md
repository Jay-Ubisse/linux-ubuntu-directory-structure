# Linux Ubuntu Directory Structure

Linux Ubuntu follows a hierarchical directory structure, with the root (`/`) as the top-level directory. Below is an overview of the common directories in Ubuntu:

## **Ubuntu Directory Structure**

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | The root directory that contains all other directories. |
| `/bin` | Essential binary executables (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`). |
| `/boot` | Files needed for booting (e.g., Linux kernel, GRUB). |
| `/dev` | Device files representing hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disk). |
| `/etc` | System-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). |
| `/home` | User home directories (e.g., `/home/user`). |
| `/lib` | Essential shared libraries required for system binaries. |
| `/media` | Mount point for removable media (USB drives, CDs). |
| `/mnt` | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems. |
| `/opt` | Optional software and third-party applications. |
| `/proc` | Virtual filesystem for process and kernel information. |
| `/root` | Home directory for the root user. |
| `/run` | Temporary runtime data for processes (cleared on reboot). |
| `/sbin` | System binaries for administrative tasks (`fdisk`, `iptables`). |
| `/srv` | Data for services (web servers, FTP, etc.). |
| `/sys` | Virtual filesystem with system information (e.g., hardware details). |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (cleared on reboot). |
| `/usr` | User binaries and programs (e.g., `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local`). |
| `/var` | Variable data such as logs (`/var/log`), cache, and spool files. |
